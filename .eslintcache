If Merchant elects to refund a Customer for any reason, such election shall not obligate Toppings to provide a corresponding reimbursement to Merchant. In the event that a Merchant Product has been visibly damaged with proof from Customer, Toppings may reimburse Merchant for all or a portion of the order subtotal.

Merchant agrees to communicate to Toppings any disagreement, non-conformity or any issue with any transaction, fee, charge or order within 60 days of the transaction, fee or order. Merchant shall be deemed to have acquiesced in and ratified, and to have waived any claim or objection regarding, each transaction, fee, charge and order if Merchant does not communicate a written claim or objection to Toppings regarding such transaction, fee, charge or order within such 60-day period.</li>\n                <li>Merchant agrees that Merchant holds title to the goods or products that Merchant provides through the Platform until the goods are picked up from Merchant, and that title passes from the Merchant to the Customer upon pickup at the Merchant’s location.

THIS SECTION 19 OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE REFERRED TO AS THE “ARBITRATION AGREEMENT”.\n              <ol>\n                <li><b>Scope of Arbitration Agreement.</b> Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of, relating to or in connection with this contract, including the breach, termination or validity thereof, shall be finally resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (1) you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify, so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis; and (2) you or Toppings may seek injunctive relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). Toppings and Merchant agree that, because both are business entities that mutually benefit from streamlined and confidential resolution, this Arbitration Agreement shall apply to all disputes arising from or relating to the subject matter of this Agreement or the relationship between the parties and their personnel. In that regard, this Arbitration Agreement shall be binding upon and enforceable by not only the parties, but also their affiliates, and their owners, officers, directors, managers and employees. This Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all claims that arose or were asserted before the Effective Date of this Agreement. CASES HAVE BEEN FILED AGAINST TOPPINGS—AND OTHERS MAY BE FILED IN THE FUTURE—THAT ATTEMPT TO ASSERT CLASS ACTION CLAIMS, AND BY ACCEPTING THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT YOU ELECT NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN SUCH CASES. IF YOU AGREE TO ARBITRATION WITH TOPPINGS, YOU ARE AGREEING IN ADVANCE THAT YOU WILL NOT PARTICIPATE IN OR SEEK TO RECOVER MONETARY OR OTHER RELIEF IN ANY SUCH CLASS, COLLECTIVE, AND/OR REPRESENTATIVE LAWSUIT. INSTEAD, BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATION, YOU MAY BRING YOUR CLAIMS AGAINST TOPPINGS IN AN INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION PROCEEDING. IF SUCCESSFUL ON SUCH CLAIMS, YOU COULD BE AWARDED MONEY OR OTHER RELIEF BY AN ARBITRATOR.</li>\n                <li><b>Informal Resolution. You and Toppings agree that good-faith informal efforts to resolve disputes often can result in a prompt, low-cost and mutually beneficial outcome. You and Toppings therefore agree that, before either you or Toppings demands arbitration against the other, we will personally meet and confer, via telephone or videoconference, in a good-faith effort to resolve informally any claim covered by this mutual Arbitration Agreement. If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you shall also fully participate in the conference. The party initiating the claim must give notice to the other party in writing of its, his, or her intent to initiate an informal dispute resolution conference, which shall occur within 60 days after the other party receives such notice, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties. To notify Toppings that you intend to initiate an informal dispute resolution conference, email Merchant.Informal.Resolution@Toppings.com, providing your name, telephone number associated with your Toppings account (if any), the email address associated with your Toppings account, and a description of your claim. In the interval between the party receiving such notice and the informal dispute resolution conference, the parties shall be free to attempt to resolve the initiating party’s claims. Engaging in an informal dispute resolution conference is a requirement that must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration.  The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution process required by this paragraph.</b></li>\n                <li><b>Arbitration Rules and Forum.</b> This Arbitration Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act in all respects. If for whatever reason the rules and procedures of the Federal Arbitration Act cannot apply, the state law governing arbitration agreements in the state in which you reside shall apply. Before a party may begin an arbitration proceeding, that party must send notice of an intent to initiate arbitration and certifying completion of the informal dispute resolution conference pursuant to paragraph 19(2). If this notice is being sent to Toppings, it must be sent by email to the counsel who represented Toppings in the informal dispute resolution process, or if there was no such counsel then by mail to General Counsel, at 5190 Ivy Nole Cumming, GA 30040. The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS under its rules and pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, but in the event of a conflict between the two, the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement shall supersede any and all conflicting arbitration administrator’s rules or procedures. Arbitration demands filed with JAMS must include (1) the name, telephone number, mailing address, and e-mail address of the party seeking arbitration; (2) a statement of the legal claims being asserted and the factual bases of those claims; (3) a description of the remedy sought and an accurate, good-faith calculation of the amount in controversy, enumerated in United States Dollars (any request for injunctive relief or attorneys’ fees shall not count toward the calculation of the amount in controversy unless such injunctive relief seeks the payment of money); and (4) the signature of the party seeking arbitration. Disputes involving claims and counterclaims under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/; all other claims shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/. JAMS’s rules are also available at www.jamsadr.com (under the Rules/Clauses tab) or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267. Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitration fees will be governed by JAMS’s rules. If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, video conference, or in person in the country where you live or at another mutually agreed location.</li>\n                <li><b>Arbitrator Powers.</b> The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. All disputes regarding the payment of arbitrator or arbitration-organization fees including the timing of such payments and remedies for nonpayment, shall be determined exclusively by an arbitrator, and not by any court. The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Toppings. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other proceedings or parties. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and this Agreement (including this Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator will issue a written statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which any award (or decision not to render an award) is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator shall follow the applicable law. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The arbitrator’s decision is final and binding on you and Toppings.</li>\n                <li><b>Waiver of Jury Trial.</b>YOU AND TOPPINGS WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND RECEIVE A JUDGE OR JURY TRIAL. You and Toppings are instead electing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration, except as specified in Section 19(1) above. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.</li>\n                <li><b>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions; Severability.</b> YOU AND TOPPINGS AGREE TO WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO RESOLVE CLAIMS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE MERCHANT CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If, however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable with respect to a particular claim or dispute, neither you nor Toppings is entitled to arbitration of such claim or dispute. Instead, all such claims and disputes will then be resolved in a court as set forth in Section 20, and all other provisions of this Section 19 (Dispute Resolution) shall remain in force. If any provision of this Section 19 is adjudged to be void or otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, the void or unenforceable provision shall be severed and such adjudication shall not affect the validity of the remainder of this Section 19. Nothing in this provision shall prevent you or Toppings from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.</li>\n                <li><b>Opt Out.</b> Toppings’s updates to these Terms of Service do not provide a new opportunity to opt out of the Arbitration Agreement if you had previously agreed to a version of Toppings’s Terms of Service and did not validly opt out of arbitration. Toppings will continue to honor the valid opt outs of merchants who validly opted out of the Arbitration Agreement in a prior version of the Terms of Service. If you create a Toppings account for the first time on or after December 9, 2020, you may opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you do so, neither you nor Toppings can force the other to arbitrate as a result of this Agreement. To opt out, you must notify Toppings in writing of your intention to opt out by sending a letter, by First Class Mail, to Toppings, Inc., 5190 Ivy Nole Cumming GA 30040. Any attempt to opt out by email will be ineffective. To be effective, your opt-out notice must be postmarked no later than 30 days after your first order on the Platform. Your notice must include your name and address, your Toppings username (if any), the email address you used to set up your Toppings account (if you have one), and a CLEAR statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. The letter may opt out, at most, only one merchant, and letters that purport to opt out multiple merchants will not be effective as to any. No merchant (or his or her agent or representative) may effectuate an opt out on behalf of other persons. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may have entered into with us or may enter into in the future with us.</li>\n                <li><b>Survival. This Arbitration Agreement will survive any termination of your relationship with Toppings.</b></li>\n                <li><b>Modification. Notwithstanding any provision in the Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if Toppings makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, it will not apply to any individual claim(s) that you had already provided notice of to the Company.</b></li>\n              </ol>\n            </li>\n            <li><b>Litigation Class Action Waiver. To the extent allowed by applicable law, separate and apart from the Mutual Arbitration Provision found in Section 19, Merchant agrees that any proceeding to litigate in court any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, whether because Merchant opted out of the Arbitration Provision or any other reason, will be conducted solely on an individual basis, and Merchant agrees not to seek to have any controversy, claim or dispute heard as a class action, a representative action, a collective action, a private attorney-general action, or in any proceeding in which Merchant acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity (“Litigation Class Action Waiver”). Merchant further agrees that no proceeding will be joined, consolidated, or combined with another proceeding, without the prior written consent of all parties to any such proceeding. If a court of competent jurisdiction determines that all or part of this Litigation Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void or voidable, the remainder of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.</b></li>\n            <li><b>Franchisees.</b>Franchisees operating a branded restaurant or store concept licensed by Merchant may participate in the Program pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement provided that the individual franchisee: (1) is in compliance with its franchise agreement; and (2) enters into an agreement in substantially the same form as the Supplemental Agreement provided by Toppings to the Franchisee. Unless the parties mutually agree otherwise in writing, all Merchant owned branded restaurant(s) and store concept(s) shall be included and subject to the terms hereunder.</li>\n            <li><b>Communications from Toppings.</b> Merchant agrees to accept and receive communications from Toppings or Toppers, including via email, text message, calls, and push notifications to the cellular telephone number Merchant provides to Toppings. Merchant acknowledges that Merchant may receive communications generated by automatic telephone dialing systems and/or which will deliver prerecorded messages sent by or on behalf of Toppings, its affiliated companies and/or Toppers. Merchant may opt out of such communications in Merchant’s Account Settings or by replying “STOP” from the mobile device receiving such messages.</li>\n            <li><b>Attorneys’ Fees.</b> In any legal action to enforce the terms of this Agreement, the prevailing party in such action shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs from the other party.</li>\n            <li><b>General Provisions.</b> As set forth on the Sign-Up Sheet between Merchant and Toppings, the Sign-Up Sheet and these Terms constitute an integrated Agreement between the parties, which supersedes all prior agreements and communications of the parties, oral or written, with respect to the subject matter hereof. The rights and obligations set forth in these Terms, which by their nature should, or by their express terms do, survive or extend beyond the termination or expiration of these Terms shall so survive and extend. This Agreement is governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to the conflicts of laws principles thereof. Merchant agrees that, except as set forth above in Section 19 (“Dispute Resolution”), the parties hereby consent to exclusive jurisdiction in the courts of the Merchant’s location. Merchant may not assign this Agreement in whole or in part without Toppings’s prior written consent. Toppings may freely assign this Agreement. This Agreement is binding upon, and inures to the benefit of, the employees, representatives, agents, affiliates, franchisors, franchisees, and permitted successors and assigns of each party, but shall not confer any rights or remedies upon any third party. All notices, requests, consents and other communications under the Parties' agreements must be in writing, and delivered by overnight courier to the addresses set forth on the Sign-Up Sheet (or any updated address properly noticed hereunder). Toppings’s address is 5190 Ivy Nole, Cumming, GA 30040. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect any other provisions of this Agreement, and this Agreement will be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained here.</li>\n          </ol>\n        </div>\n\n        {/*<button>Export as PDF</button>*/}\n      </div>\n    </article>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default PortalTermsService;\n","/Users/junmei/src/toppings-vendor/src/pages/PortalRewards.js",["203","204","205","206","207","208","209","210","211","212","213","214","215","216","217","218","219","220","221"],"import React, { useState, useEffect, useRef } from 'react';\n\nimport Amplify, { Auth, API, graphqlOperation } from 'aws-amplify';\n\nimport awsConfig from '../utils/awsConfig';\nimport * as queries from '../graphql/queries';\nimport * as mutations from '../graphql/mutations';\nimport * as customQueries from '../graphql/customQueries';\nimport * as customMutations from '../graphql/customMutations';\n\nimport bubbleIcon from '../assets/images/bubble-icon-2.svg';\nimport loadingBubbleIcon from '../assets/images/bubble-icon-1.svg';\n\nfunction PortalRewards(props) {\n  const defaultReward = {\n    name: \"Jelly Joy\", \n    points: 5, \n    description: \"10% discount on all jelly patties\"\n  };\n  const nameInput = useRef();\n  const pointsInput = useRef();\n  const descriptionInput = useRef();\n\n  const [mode, changeMode] = useState(\"\");\n  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);\n  const [selectedRewardItem, selectRewardItem] = useState(defaultReward);\n  const [rewardItems, setRewardItems] = useState({\n    // Rewards: [{id: 1, name: \"Jelly Joy\", price: 5, description: \"10% discount on all jelly patties.\"}, \n    //           {id: 2, name: \"Krabby Patty Happy Hour\", price: 5, description: \"10% discount on all Krabby Patties between 12PM and 3PM.\"},\n    //           {id: 3, name: \"Seanut Superstar\", price: 10, description: \"Buy one get one free Seanut Brittle.\"},]\n    Rewards: []\n  });\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    getData();\n  }, []);\n\n  async function getData() {\n    // API.graphql(graphqlOperation(queries.listVendorRewards, { filter: { menuId: { eq: props.restaurant.id } } })).then(({ data: { listVendorRewards } }) => {\n    //   setRewardItems({\n    //     Rewards: listVendorRewards.items\n    //   });\n    // }).catch((error) => {\n    //   console.log(error);\n    // });\n    setLoading(true);\n    const response = await API.graphql(graphqlOperation(customQueries.getVendorRewards, { menuId: props.restaurant.id }));\n    // const response = await API.graphql(graphqlOperation(queries.listVendorRewards, { filter: { menuId: { eq: props.restaurant.id }}}));\n    console.log(response);\n    const rewards = response.data.getVendorRewards.sort((reward1, reward2) => (reward1.points > reward2. points ?
